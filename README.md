# Safe Thinking
This script was made to replace dirty words in a thinking by safe words, making it a safe thinking, in others words, without words that you consider inappropriate.

## How it works
To run the script, you just have to execute the below command:
```bash
ruby main.rb
```

Initializing the script, it will show the home page, and in that page we have 3 options:

- Add new thinking.
- Add a new safe word.
- Exit

To make the script work, you need to put some safe words and then you type a new thinking. If the new thinking has some word previously added, the word will be replaced, else the app will maintain the thinking unchanged.
